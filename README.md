# Filipp and Ian's Adoption Center
As cat and dog lovers we wanted to create an app that would allow people to adopt animals without leaving any of them behind. By organizing our animals in a queue, we ensure that no animal gets left behind! We don't let people adopt any animal they like, they can only adopt the one that has been there the longest. 

## Link to deployed version on Heroku:

## Features
Users can view the cat and dog that are currently up for adoption, then if they choose to, they can click the adoption button, adopt the animal, then view the next dog or cat that is up for adoption.
